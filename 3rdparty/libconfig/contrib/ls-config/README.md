ls-config
=========

Simple program to use libconfig9 configuration files in bash scripts

You can use libconfig9 files directly by invoking ls-config, or in bash scripts
by sourcing lslib-core and then using simple cfg_* functions. In this case 
You must set LS_EXEC to 1 before sourcing lslib-core

Existing error codes available in: doc/ folder.

Sample usage available in: sample/ folder.

We need some help to build packaging for different systems, and with translations 
to other languages.
